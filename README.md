# Hikvision Download Assistant

A command-line tool to make searching and downloading photos and videos from your Hikvision cameras easy... 
without requiring installation of any Hikvision software on your computer!

## Usage

Hikvision Download Assistant is simple command line tool that connects to your Hikvision camera or NVR
using the ISAPI web API to perform searches for videos and photos. It writes `curl` commands to the screen
that you can then use to download each photo or video from the ISAPI API.

Like most command-line tools, it is designed to be easily composed with other command-line tools.
The list of search results goes to `stdout`.
All other helpful header and footer text is sent to `stderr` so it can be easily excluded from pipes and redirects.

Run using `java -jar hikvision-download-assistant.jar <options>`.

### Unix/MacOS pipeline examples

Filtering and choosing a column using `jq`:

```bash
java -jar hikvision-download-assistant.jar 192.168.1.64 admin $PASSWORD --quiet --output json | jq '.results[] | select(.eventType=="MOTION") | .startTime'
```

Filtering and choosing a column using `grep` and `cut`:

```bash
java -jar hikvision-download-assistant.jar 192.168.1.64 admin $PASSWORD --quiet | grep MOTION | cut -d '|' -f 3
```

Executing all of the returned curl commands to download all of the results to the current 
working directory (assuming `bash` is your shell):

```bash
java -jar hikvision-download-assistant.jar 192.168.1.64 admin $PASSWORD --quiet | cut -d '|' -f 5 | while read curl_cmd; do eval $curl_cmd; done
```

### Using `--from-time` and `--to-time`

These options take English natural language and try their best to understand what you mean.

Examples:

- `now`
- `10 pm yesterday`
- `noon yesterday`
- `5 pm` - 5 pm today
- `6:50 today` - caution, this is 6:50 AM, no matter what current time
- `6:50 am today` or `6:50 pm today` - safer alternative so you don't get AM by accident
- `last thursday` - at the current time of day, but different date
- `1 week ago` - at the current time of day, but different date
- `oct 3rd` - at the current time of day, but different date
- `2/14/20 at 2 am`
- ...[and many more](http://natty.joestelmach.com/doc.jsp)

It will not always guess correctly, so the first line of output will always print what it guessed so you can confirm.

Your `--to-time` can be a date/time in the future. This may be helpful if your camera's system time is wrong.

### The `download_days.sh` script

The [`download_days.sh`](download_days.sh) script is an example of using this app in a shell script.
It downloads all of the photos and videos for the requested number of days and then 
generates a simple web-based UI for browsing all of the downloaded photos and videos.

### Other useful command-line tips for manipulating the downloaded photos and videos

Make a playlist out of all the videos in the current directory, and then open it with VLC:

```bash
find $(pwd) -maxdepth 1 -name '*.mp4' | sort > playlist.m3u
vlc --play-and-exit --no-video-title-show playlist.m3u
```

Convert all the video files in the current directory into a format that is playable by web browsers,
assuming that you have `ffmpeg` installed:

```bash
for file in $(find $(pwd) -maxdepth 1 -name '*.mp4'); do ffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i "$file" -c copy $(dirname "$file")/$(basename "$file" .mp4).fixed.mp4; done
```

## Why would I need this?

Why, you ask? Several reasons!

- The Hikvision in-browser web UI software for browsing and downloading videos and photos is *no
  longer compatible with MacOS at all*. When you open their web UI, the "Live View" 
  and "Configuration" tabs will appear, but the "Picture" and "Playback" tabs will not appear.
- The Hikvision in-browser web UI software for browsing and downloading videos and photos for
  MS Windows works but still requires installing Hikvision software on your computer.
  Some people may not want to install this software.
- Hikvision offers a free application called
  [iVMS-4200](https://www.hikvision.com/en/products/software/ivms-4200/)
  which does offer these capabilities, which does work on both MacOS and Windows.
  However, some people might wish to avoid installing it.
  Some users have complained in online forums about the design and usability of the application.
  Also, installing this software on a Mac requires entering your admin password several times,
  indicating that it is making some kind of changes to your OS, and it's not clear how to uninstall
  all of its side effects.
- There doesn't seem to be a linux version of iVMS-4200, so there is no obvious way to download
  photos and videos on a linux computer.
- Both the Hikvision web UI and the iVMS-4200 only allow you to download one 
  page of video or photo search results at a time, so it is not clear how to easily download
  large numbers of photos and videos.
- You can still configure your camera using the Hikvision in-browser web UI software, so if
  there were another tool to help you download videos and photos, then you wouldn't need to
  install any software from Hikvision. Well, now there is!

## Prerequisites

### Prerequisites on your computer

This application is written in Java, and therefore can run on pretty much any platform.

You'll need a Java Runtime Environment on your computer. It must be Java version 11 or higher.

Good news, you might already have one! Open your command terminal and type `java -version` to check.

Don't have one? You could install any JRE that you like, for example you could
choose to install [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html), 
e.g. `brew install openjdk` on a Mac.

### Prerequisites on your Hikvision device(s)

There are no prerequisites on your camera. Here are some helpful tips for configuring your camera.

Note that this app uses digest authentication, which is the default setting on Hikvision cameras, so you do *not* need
to enable basic authentication to use this app. You also do *not* need to enable Hikvision-CGI to use this app.

You'll want to make sure that your camera's system clock is correct. You can check this in the camera's web UI
under System -> System Settings -> Time Settings. You'll probably also want to set the correct time zone on that
same web page.

You may wish to enable the Daylight Savings Time feature to avoid having your computer's
time and your camera's time differ by one hour in the summer. This can be enabled in the camera's web UI
under System -> System Settings -> DST. Be sure to also change the DST start time, end time, and bias
to match your local DST schedule.
For the US you would check the `Enable DST box`, start on `Mar Second Sun 02`, end on `Nov First Sun 02`, 
and set a bias of `60minutes`. Don't forget to click "Save".

If you are formatting an sdcard in the Hikvision camera's web UI, you can choose the
photo to video ratio for setting quotas on the same web page. These settings only apply during formatting, so be
sure to set these to your preferred values before you format the sdcard.

You may wish to set up [motion-activated recording](https://www.vueville.com/home-security/cctv/ip-cameras/hikvision-motion-detection-setup).

You may also wish to set up [event-triggered photos](http://hikvision.com/UploadFile/File/2014331155115857.pdf)
to automatically take a series of photos for every motion event, in addition to the video.

### Related tools (not required)

- You'll probably want [`curl`](https://ec.haxx.se), but you already have that.
- You might like to install [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) to view
  the downloaded videos, e.g. `brew cask install vlc` on a Mac.
- You might like [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org) to convert the downloaded videos, 
  e.g. `brew install ffmpeg` on a Mac.

## Compatible cameras and DVR/NVRs

This was developed and tested using my Hikvision model DS-2CD2185FWD-I IP camera
using Firmware version `V5.6.3 build 190923`.

Theoretically, it should work with any Hikvision camera.

I believe that the Hikvision NVRs offer the same ISAPI endpoint (`POST /ISAPI/ContentMgmt/search`) so
it should theoretically work with those too.

You mileage may vary. Github issues and PRs are welcome.

## Installing hikvision-download-assistant

Download the latest release jar file from 
https://github.com/cfryanr/hikvision-download-assistant/releases/latest
in your browser.

Or download with `curl`, assuming you're using `bash` as your shell and that want to keep the file in `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin && { curl -fLO https://github.com/cfryanr/hikvision-download-assistant/releases/download/v1.1.0/hikvision-download-assistant.jar; cd -; }
```

If you would like to use `download_days.sh`, then download it to the same directory as the jar file:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin && { curl -fLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cfryanr/hikvision-download-assistant/v1.1.0/download_days.sh; chmod 755 download_days.sh; cd -; }
```

## Building

If you would prefer to compile the source code yourself, you'll need to install a Java JDK, 
e.g. `brew install openjdk` on a Mac.

To build, run `./mvnw clean package` from the top-level directory of the project.

The compiler will output a file called `target/hikvision-download-assistant-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
If you'd like, you can copy this to whatever directory and filename you like.

Run it with `java -jar target/hikvision-download-assistant-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar <options>`
